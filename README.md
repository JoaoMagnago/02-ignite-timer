# Timer

A study project with **Vite**, **React** and **Typescript** with the goal of practicing form control and validation, as well as the usage of reducers and basic react hooks.

An application with a timer to help you keep track of any task or activity you want to control. It also saves your active and previous times in a history page.

Some important libraries used are:
* [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) (for form control)
* [Zod](https://zod.dev/) (for form validation)
* [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) (for time manipulation methods and logic)
